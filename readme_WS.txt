this was for standard HC-04sr %volts  .  So i power this with 5V and echo went to microbit throuhg 1,2 kom resistor and greed diode (that lovered Voltage). I kno taht this is not perfect byt
protected microbit port.

Trigger is 3,2 Volt and this is mebye to little and i had to  increase signal by 10/6 .  I guess this is due to Voltage 5/3.2 volts (?) difference. It seems to work :)
